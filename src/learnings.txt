1. Do not use the state inside the useeffect hook. You can set the state but dont use the state as an input. i.e. 
    Do this
        setMoney(...)  ---> here you're setting the state
    Don't do this
        getSUm(item)   ---> here item is the state
2. Keep the javascript functions outisde the component and use it inside as needed
3. Local storage only accepts strings so we do JSON.stringify
